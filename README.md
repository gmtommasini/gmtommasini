    <summary><b>About me:</b></summary>
    <p> My name is Guilherme, but I usually go by "Gui" to ease everyone's life! I've been working in IT for about 10 years now. Before IT, I taught Physics in High School for a few years - I do have a Teaching degree and a BSc in Physics, and in 2021 I got my diploma in Computer Programming.</p>
   <p>For the first few years of my IT career, I worked in major banks, in Capital Market related projects, mainly creating documentation and building service buses and micro services. But I also touched a bit of Java, Shell, SQL (MySQL, Oracle, Sybase), and so on.</p>
    <p>More recently I've worked more with Java, Python, React and got to work more closely with AWS cloud, Docker and Kubernetes.</p>
